Installation Notes for Modules with S-PLUS for Windows

Installation
============

1. Insert the S-PLUS for Windows CD in your machine's disk drive.

2. If your machine has CD-ROM Autoplay enabled, the S-PLUS Master Setup 
   installation appears automatically.  Otherwise, open Microsoft Windows
   Explorer and run the setup.exe program directly. It is a good idea to 
   turn off other applications while installing modules, in particular
   virus checkers and screen savers.

3. Click the "Install Modules" button, then select the module to 
   install. Follow the onscreen instructions.

4. Install the license key. This process is described in the S-PLUS
   Installation and Administration Guide.
   

Starting the Module
===================

Each module must be loaded before it can be used at the start
of each S-PLUS session.  After S-PLUS has started, either:

A. Select "File > Load Module" from the main menu, and choose the module
from the list of available modules, or:

B. In the Commands Window, type

        module(modulename, first=T)

   where 'modulename' is the name of the module.
